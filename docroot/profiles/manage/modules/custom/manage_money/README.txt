Manage Money Module
-----------------------------------------
The Manage Money Module gives the user the ability to add content that will allow them to manage their spending in a view by month. It also allows you to add recurring spending amounts, edit existing amounts, see the totals at the end of each month (cumulatively keeping track of the totals from the previous month and taking that into consideration when calculating next months totals). It also allows you to generate a new "current total" based on spending items prior to the current date, and also hide those entries for ease of viewing ans usage.

Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------
Download the module, place in your modules directory, and enable.

Configuraton Instructions
-----------------------------------------
Navigate to /admin/config/content/money_config to make changes to your "current total" and perform the generation tasks.
